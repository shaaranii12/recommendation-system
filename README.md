# Movie Recommendation System 

### Live Demo  
ðŸ”— Try it here: [Movie Recommender](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Shaaranii12/reccomendation-model)  

## Overview  
The Movie Recommender System suggests movies based on user input using content-based filtering.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to analyze movie overviews and compute similarity scores.
The system is built with Gradio for a simple, user-friendly interface and integrates with the OMDb API to fetch real-time movie posters and plot summaries.
This project is part of my data science portfolio and demonstrates skills in Recommender Systems, NLP, and API integration. 

## Features  
âœ… Search by Movie Title â€“ Enter a movie name and get similar movie recommendations. <br>
âœ… Content-Based Filtering â€“ Uses TF-IDF + cosine similarity for recommendations. <br>
âœ… Movie Details via OMDb API â€“ Displays poster & short plot summary for each recommendation. <br>
âœ… Interactive App: Simple and user-friendly interface for real-time emotion detection.  

## Screenshots
The model was fine-tuned using the j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base transformer, and evaluated to measure its performance across different emotion categories
